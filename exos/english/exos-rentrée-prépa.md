### Résumé

On June 9, 2020, at Houston, politicians and relatives of the police violence victim George Floyd spoke at his funeral. A 17-minute procession was held, where some noticed that more and more non-black people are raising up against racial injustice in the United States.

George Floyd was sent to prison for 4 years after being guilty of armed aggravated robbery, and after being released, was set on helping people avoid his own mistakes. But after some suspected him of paying with a counterfeit $20 bill, Minneapolis officers confronted him and are now facing criminal charges, as one of them kneeled on George Floyd for almost nine minutes, killing him despite his calls for help and the now-famous "I can't breathe". This man has become a symbol of police brutality against black people. 

## Commentaire

George Floyd's death has definitely become a symbol of police officers being way too brutal and racist, around the whole world. Racism is definitely a big issue, especially in America where it's deeply rooted in the country's history and even genesis. 

There are a number of reasons why many countries stopped killing people for crimes they comitted: 
- what if the judge was mistaken? that person would be dead while having done nothing.
- what if humans could learn from their mistakes (and they do), and deserved a second chance? putting them in prison will let them think about their actions deeply and stop from comitting crimes again or, even better,  try to help others in the same situation as theirs (as George Floyd tried to do).
- what if killing someone was just not ethical? 

What is even worse here is that George Floyd was _suspected_ of using a fake _$10_ bill. Even if the police officer knew it was true, is killing someone because of fake bill usage justifiable? Anyone can actually posses fake bills without even knowing it, because money changes hands.

On top of all of this, no white man would be arrested by this police officer for this "crime", and we all know that too well.
